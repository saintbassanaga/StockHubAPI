# StockHub API

**StockHub API** is a robust and scalable solution for managing inventory, stock levels, and sales operations. This API is designed for businesses looking to streamline their stock management processes with a reliable backend system. The initial version lays the foundation for future scalability and modularity, allowing for easy transition into a microservices architecture.

## Key Features of Stock Hub API

### Version 1: Basic Monolithic API with Core Features

#### Objective:
The goal of Version 1 is to build a **basic, monolithic stock management API** that handles essential functionalities within a single codebase. This initial version focuses on product management, stock monitoring, and recording simple sales, providing a solid base for future development.

#### Features:
- **Product Management**:
    - Add, update, view, and delete products.
- **Stock Management**:
    - View stock levels and manually adjust inventory.
- **Sales Management**:
    - Record sales transactions and automatically reduce stock quantities.
- **Basic User Authentication**:
    - Implement simple user management with roles such as admin and salesperson for basic security.

#### Database:
- Utilizes a single relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that houses tables for products, stock, sales, and user data.

#### Architecture:
- Monolithic structure with RESTful endpoints for handling product, stock, sales, and user operations.
- All components reside within a unified codebase, eliminating the need for inter-service communication.

#### Evolution Strategy:
- Focus on writing clean, modular code with well-defined boundaries between the product, stock, and sales modules.
- Ensure that API contracts are clear and maintainable, facilitating an easy migration to microservices in future releases.
